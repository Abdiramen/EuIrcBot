# EuIrcBot

A featureful nodejs irc bot

This contains a large number of modules in the modules folder, and almost no documentation.

The code is the documentation, right?

## Installation

`yarn install`; this will also install all modules

## Status

A rewrite is in process which uses RPC to be polyglot. It's backwards compatible with these modules already via an adapter module manager (one of many), but isn't out there yet... still needs more polish.

In the meantime, this is still supported.
